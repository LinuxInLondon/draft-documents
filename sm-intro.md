Linuxing in London is the place for all things Linux*. It is an initiative to explore everything related to Linux from the server, to the desktop, the IoT, the Cloud, and beyond.

Our objectives are to:

    * provide an engaging platform for industry speakers, educators, specialists and enthusiasts
    * inform a wider audience on the benefits of Linux usage, the challenges happening in the industry
    * stimulate appropriate debate on key technical themes
    * encourage participation from the entire London tech community

Every month we will actively seek out talks from top Linux vendors, experts, and from our community.

We encourage a large range of Linux fans to educate, exchange views, and be better informed through the open source revolution that is Linux!

Active diversity is central to Linuxing in London. Please be sure to take a look at our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/linuxing-london/draft-documents/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and understand that each of us are bound by its guidelines.

Please contact us if you have any constructive suggestions.
