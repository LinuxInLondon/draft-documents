* Visibility – a speaker can be an true asset to our agenda, increase event attendance and attract overall interest

#### What our community asks from you
* The emphasis should be on the audience learning
* Direct promotion of your services, or products, must be cleared ahead of your presentation, and take up no more than 10% of your overall presentation running time
* Members are not fans of direct pitching
* If you've managed to present your expertise well on the topic, anyone wishing to know more from you is to be invited to take your contact details or speak to you off line
* Linux is an Open Source product and ask of you to respect that not everyone is comfortable with the traditional top-down enterprise pitch
